**We are an independent research organisation** focused on revealing the
trends, causes, and health impacts, as well as the solutions to air
pollution.

**Health-harming pollutants from burning fossil fuels** are responsible
for at least 3 million air pollution deaths per year. However, rapid
advances in modern, clean energy technologies are a key opportunity to
improve air quality and protect public health.

**We use scientific data, research and evidence** to support the
efforts of governments, companies and campaigning organizations
worldwide in their efforts to move towards clean energy and clean air.
We believe that effective research and communication are the key to
successful policies, investment decisions and advocacy efforts.

We use this GitHub organisation to develop our data platforms and
analyses.
